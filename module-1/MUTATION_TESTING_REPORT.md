## **2️ What These Results Mean**
### **82.35% Mutation Score – Good But Not Perfect**
Mutation testing checks if small changes (mutations) to your smart contract cause your tests to fail. 
- **A mutation score of 82.35% is good but suggests room for improvement.**
- Ideally, we want **>90%**, meaning your tests should catch and kill almost all introduced mutations.
- **30 mutants survived ("live")**, meaning your test suite failed to detect issues introduced by these mutations.

### **140 Killed Mutants – Strong Coverage**
- These mutants were killed, meaning your test suite successfully **detected and failed** the contract when modifications were made.
- **Types of mutations caught:**
  - **Assignment Operator Replacements (AOR)** (e.g., `-=` to `+=`)
  - **Binary Operator Replacements (BOR)** (e.g., `<` to `>=`)
  - **Exception Handling Statement Changes (EHC)** (e.g., removing `require()` statements)
  - **Ether Transfer Replacements (ETR)** (e.g., replacing `.call()` with `.delegatecall()`)
  - **Global Variable Replacements (GVR)** (e.g., replacing `msg.value` with `tx.gasprice`)

These results indicate that your test suite is effectively verifying the contract logic and preventing unintended behaviors.

### **30 Live Mutants – Potential Weaknesses**
- These mutants **survived**, meaning your test suite **did NOT catch the changes** in the contract logic.
- **Main areas of concern:**
  - **Integer Literal Replacement (ILR)** → Some hardcoded values changed (e.g., `1000000 ether` to `1000001 ether`), but tests didn't fail.
  - **Transaction Origin Replacement (TOR)** → `msg.sender` was replaced with `tx.origin`, yet the tests didn’t detect this security flaw.
  - **Function Visibility Replacement (FVR)** → Changing `external` functions to `public` or `private` did not trigger failures.
  - **Variable Visibility Replacement (VVR)** → Changing public constants to internal or private was not caught.
  - **Event Emission Deletion (EED)** → Removing event logs did not cause test failures.

**These live mutants suggest gaps in your test coverage.**  
Your tests may **not be verifying function access control, transaction handling, or event emissions properly**.

### **14 Stillborn Mutants – Dead on Arrival**
- These mutations **were never executed** due to syntax errors or compiler issues.
- Most **involved constructor changes, modifier order modifications, or function visibility alterations**.
- These **do not impact test coverage but may indicate redundant or unused functionality in the contract**.

### **3️ Next Steps to Improve Coverage**
#### **Fix Tests to Kill Live Mutants**
For each **live mutant**, inspect its impact and improve tests accordingly. 

- **Address `TOR (Transaction Origin Replacement)` Live Mutants**
  - Your tests **failed to detect** changes where `msg.sender` was replaced with `tx.origin`.
  - This is a **major security risk**, as `tx.origin` is vulnerable to phishing attacks.
  - **Fix:** Ensure access control checks use `msg.sender`, and add specific tests that fail when `tx.origin` is used.

- **Address `ILR (Integer Literal Replacement)` Live Mutants**
  - Some values like `1000000 ether` changed to `1000001 ether` but were not detected.
  - **Fix:** Add boundary tests to confirm exact token calculations.

- **Address `FVR (Function Visibility Replacement)` Live Mutants**
  - Functions that changed from `external` to `public` or `private` were not caught.
  - **Fix:** Add explicit function visibility tests.

- **Address `EED (Event Emission Deletion)` Live Mutants**
  - Removing events like `DebugAllowance()` did not cause test failures.
  - **Fix:** Ensure events are included in test assertions.

#### ** Improve Test Assertions**
- Add **tests that explicitly check access control**.
- Ensure **event emissions are checked** in test cases.
- **Test for exact values** in calculations (especially hardcoded limits).

#### ** Re-run SuMo**
Once tests are improved:
```sh
npx sumo test
```
Aim for **>90% mutation score**.

### **4️ Summary of Findings**
| **Category**  | **Count**  | **Meaning**  | **Next Steps**  |
|--------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| **Generated Mutants** | 184 | Number of mutations introduced | - |
| **Tested Mutants** | 170 | Successfully tested | - |
| **Killed Mutants** | 140 | Tests detected mutation | Good coverage  |
| **Live Mutants** | 30 | Tests failed to detect mutation | Fix gaps in test cases  |
| **Mutation Score** | 82.35% | Shows test effectiveness | Aim for **>90%**  |
| **Stillborn Mutants** | 14 | Compilation issues | Likely irrelevant |

**Key Takeaways**
- **Your tests are effective but have gaps.**
- **30 live mutants indicate untested logic vulnerabilities.**
- **Focus on transaction security, function visibility, and numeric precision.**
- **Fix the tests and re-run SuMo to reach 90%+.**

# Important Note on SuMo Installation

To make SuMo work, ensure the directory where you want to install SuMo has a package.json file. Otherwise, it will be installed in the root directory.

## Installation Steps:

## Step 1: Ensure a package.json file exists (create if needed)
echo '{}' > package.json  # Creates a blank placeholder file

Then insert this format :
```
{
    "name": "",
    "devDependencies": {
        "",
        
    }
}
```

## Step 2: Install SuMo
npm install @morenabarboni/sumo --save-dev

## Step 3: Run mutation tests
npx sumo test  # Run this command in the same directory as sumo-config.js
